  <p>Founded in 2024, the League of Champs Dynasty League is a long awaited spinoff of the League of Champs</p>
  <p>Featuring 8 of the same managers as the LoC, this league is sure to build upon the greatness and longevity of the LoC. Managers will need to adapt to having a long-term outlook and not letting a yearly fantasy mindset impact their dynasty approach</p>
  <p>Managers Tathya, Zach, Jack, and Big Sleep will look to continue their fantasy dominance, while Evan, Derek, Glenn, and Jarret look to finally enter the upper echelon of League of Champs managers. However, this rise will be put to the test by fierce newcomers Bray and Sal who hope to make an immediate mark on the league</p>
